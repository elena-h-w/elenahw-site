I've partnered closely with Product and Engineering to shape positioning, rollout strategy, and lifecycle programs that translate customer insight into measurable usage and revenue impact.",
  "As AI reshapes how products are built and distributed, I've been prototyping AI-powered workflows end-to-end using AI-assisted development (“vibe coding”) and deploying them to production. This hands-on experience taught me what it takes to build usable AI products: structured inputs, iteration loops, and tradeoffs around latency and inference cost.",
  "My goal is to help AI companies bridge technical capability with clear positioning, combining hands-on product understanding with distribution strategy that drives sustained adoption and growth.",
  "Outside of work, I’m an avid traveler who has visited over 50 countries across all seven continents — an experience that deepens my curiosity about how different cultures approach and solve problems, shaping how I think about marketing and building products for diverse users. I also enjoy staying active, challenging myself, and hitting goals — including finishing the NYC Marathon a few years ago.",
