                I don&apos;t usually share personal stories. But if you&apos;ve been thinking about
                starting something and keep putting it off, this might be the push you need.

              <p style={{ fontSize: 16, lineHeight: 1.75, color: "var(--ink-soft)" }}>
                Eight weeks ago, I went on a ski trip to Aspen Snowmass. What was supposed
                to be a simple vacation ended with an accident and a compression fracture
                in my lumbar spine.
              </p>

              <p style={{ fontSize: 16, lineHeight: 1.75, color: "var(--ink-soft)" }}>
                I was very active before the injury. Suddenly the things I had planned for
                the winter — skiing, running, everything I&apos;d looked forward to — were off
                the table. Evenings and weekends that used to fill themselves were empty.
              </p>

              <p style={{ fontSize: 16, lineHeight: 1.75, color: "var(--ink-soft)" }}>
                So I decided to use the time intentionally.

              <p style={{ fontSize: 16, lineHeight: 1.75, color: "var(--ink-soft)" }}>
                I&apos;m a marketer by day with no engineering background and no experience
                building websites or mobile apps. But I&apos;d been curious about AI-assisted
                building for a while. I wanted to see what I was capable of creating on
                my own, outside of my full-time job.

              <p style={{ fontSize: 16, lineHeight: 1.75, color: "var(--ink-soft)" }}>
                I started with a web app and built it from concept to production in under
                10 days, using tools like ChatGPT and Claude to help modify code and
                integrate APIs.
              </p>

              <p style={{ fontSize: 16, lineHeight: 1.75, color: "var(--ink-soft)" }}>

                — a networking tracker app for professionals who want to be more
                intentional about their careers. The problem isn&apos;t that professionals
                don&apos;t network. It&apos;s that there&apos;s no simple, dedicated place to capture
                what happens in those conversations and follow up before the moment
                passes. I believe the problem is real, so I decided to build the solution
                myself.

                Something I didn&apos;t expect from this process: building has made me a
                sharper marketer. Wearing many hats changes how you think about strategy,
                prioritization, and what actually matters to users.

                What started as a difficult stretch turned into something I&apos;m genuinely
                proud of — two products and a new identity.

                Eight weeks ago I would have said I&apos;m a marketer. Today I describe myself

                Sometimes the hardest moments open doors you didn&apos;t plan for. The only
